# Competitive Programming Practice
This is a competitive programming practice repo for the AdaByron and AceptaElReto judges and some tther competitions like 2025 Advent of Code.

I am not the best at competitive programming, but I enjoy it. 
I code my solutions in Python and translate them, with the help of some LLM's, to C++ as that's the most used and accepted programming language in CP. 
I don't know C++ very well, so I am learning it as I go along.
