# Competitive Programming Practice
This is a competitive programming practice repo for the AdaByron and AceptaElReto judges. Other competitions aren't ruled out and could be added in the future.

I am not the best at competitive programming, but I enjoy it. 
I code my solutions in Python and translate them, with the help of some LLM's, to C++ as that's the most used and accepted programming language in CP.  

Any bugfixes, optimizations, or advide are welcome!
